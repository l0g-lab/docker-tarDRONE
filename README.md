# docker-tarDRONE

I made this repo to dockerize scripts for drone RemoteID sniffing. See [zmqToTar1090](https://github.com/l0g-lab/zmqToTar1090) for more information.

** There has been an update to the Sniffle project which requires manually setting the baud rate for the sniff_receiver.py script. See the following from the Sniffle project [README](https://github.com/bkerler/Sniffle/blob/zmq/README.md)**
```
In 2022, due to COVID-19 pandemic chip shortages, some Sonoff CC2652P dongles were built with CP2102 (non-N) USB/UART bridge chips that are capped at 921600 baud. If you have one of these, you will need to flash a different firmware image that uses a slower baud rate of 921600. This special slower baud rate build is named sniffle_cc1352p1_cc2652p1_1M.hex (build variant CC2652P1F_1M). You will also need to invoke Sniffle utilities with the option -b 921600 to override the default baud rate of 2000000.
```

## Overview

First off, huge thanks to the following devs for their work in this realm:
- Tar1090 Dev: [wiedehopf](https://github.com/wiedehopf)
- DragonOS Dev: [alphafox02](https://github.com/alphafox02) - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@cemaxecuter7783)
- Sniffle Dev: [nccgroup](https://github.com/nccgroup)

This project provides a dockerized way to track drones via RemoteID (FAA required on drones over 249 grams). It will keep a cache of drones in the local area that the BLE dongle can receive signals from and map them on tar1090. To accomplish this, it uses the following:

- a modified instance of [tar1090](https://github.com/wiedehopf/tar1090)
- [Sniffle](https://github.com/bkerler/Sniffle/tree/zmq): project for sniffing the BLE packets
- [DroneID](https://github.com/bkerler/DroneID) for decoding the BLE traffic
- [zmqToTar1090](https://github.com/l0g-lab/zmqToTar1090) for converting decoded data into specific JSON format for ingestion into tar1090

## Requirements

- Docker with BuildKit enabled
- BLE5 dongle (I use a Sonoff Zigbee 3.0 with custom firmware from [nccgroup](https://github.com/nccgroup/Sniffle))
- Drone >249 grams or a RemoteID transmitter

## Installation

1. Clone this repo to your local machine:\
    `$ git clone https://github.com/l0g-lab/docker-tarDRONE`
2. Change directory into the project:\
    `$ cd docker-tarDRONE`
3. Modify the `.env` file within the project root directory with:\
    `TZ`: Your current TimeZone\
    `LAT/LONG`: The latitude & longitude of your current location or the RemoteID receiver\
    `USB_DEVICE`: The device of your sniffle receiver dongle (normally `/dev/ttyUSB0` if you have no other devices connected)

## How to use

1. Run the project with:\
    `$ DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker-compose -f docker-compose-tarDRONE.yml up`

    This will take some time while the containers are downloaded and built.

2. Open your web browser to: `http://localhost:8078`
